Twitter Clone
=============

# Shittr, the crappy twitter clone!

Built using as little outside help as possible.
Not using any frontend frameworks, not even jQuery.
ALL vanilla JS.

It's currently a huge mess but certainly helped me learn quite alot.

## Firebase
Using firebase as a backend pretty much so I don't have to waste time on mongoDb or anything else.
